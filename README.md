# Career Aspirations of GenZ 🌱

## Project Overview
This project explores the career aspirations of Generation Z and was assigned me to complete this during my internship with KultureHire, analyzing a comprehensive survey dataset to understand their preferences, goals, and challenges in the workforce. The insights gained aim to inform educational institutions, employers, and policymakers about the expectations and needs of this emerging workforce.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of **100,580 rows** and **29 columns**, including attributes such as:

- **Age**: Age of the respondents
- **Education Level**: Highest level of education attained
- **Field of Interest**: Preferred career fields
- **Salary Expectations**: Expected salary in their chosen field
- **Work Preferences**: Preferences for remote work, work-life balance, etc.
- **Skills Assessment**: Self-assessed skills relevant to their career choices

## Key Insights 📊
- **Top Career Fields**: Technology, Healthcare, and Creative Arts are the most sought-after fields.
- **Salary Expectations**: Over **60%** of respondents expect a salary of **$50,000+** annually.
- **Work Preferences**: **75%** prefer flexible working arrangements to traditional office settings.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Analyzed the survey dataset focusing on data collection, cleaning, and standardization using Excel and SQL.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examined trends and patterns to extract meaningful insights.
3. **Dashboard Development**: Developed both executive and functional dashboards using Power BI to present findings effectively.
